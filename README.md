# YAAO
Yet Another Aerodome Overlay!

1. Add this page as a browser source in OBS:

https://norbyyt1300.github.io/YAAO/

(Also click above to see the live example of this overlay)

2. In OBS, click to "Interact" with this browser source, then click each player's name to edit the player name, click each pilot name to select the pilot, and click the HP to set the HP value. Enjoy!

3. To access an (in-progress) settings menu to allow squad imports, click the tiny gear icon in the very top-middle of the overlay.

Note: you can click on a pilot card to toggle it between high and low visibility!

And YES, there will absolutely be a second version coming soon that will have a front-end live page and a back-end settings page...
